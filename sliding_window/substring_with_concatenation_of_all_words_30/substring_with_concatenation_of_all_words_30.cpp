/*
 *  You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.
 *
 *  A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.
 *    - For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. 
 *      "acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.
 *
 *  Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.

/*
 * Initialize a frequency map by iterating over the input words and counting each occurrence.
 *
 * Loop from i = 0 to wordLen - 1. This allows us to scan the string from every possible word-aligned offset.
 *
 * For each offset:
 *   - Initialize a `seen` map to count how many times each word has appeared in the current window.
 *   - Set `left` to i (start of the window) and `total` to 0 (total words matched so far).
 *
 *   Inside this loop, slide the window by wordLen each step:
 *     - Extract the substring of length `wordLen` starting at `right`.
 *     - If the word exists in the frequency map:
 *         - Increment its count in `seen` and increment `total`.
 *         - While `seen[word]` exceeds its allowed frequency:
 *             - Decrement the count of the word at the left of the window
 *             - Move `left` forward by `wordLen` and decrement `total`
 *         - If `total == words.size()`, we found a valid substring â†’ push `left` to the result.
 *     - If the word is not in the frequency map:
 *         - Clear `seen`, reset `total` to 0, and move `left` to `right + wordLen`.
 *
 * Finally, return the result indices.
